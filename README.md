# Integrating React Image Editor with Rich Text Editor

Integrating an image editor with a React Rich Text Editor, this library provides an easy-to-use API that allows developers to quickly and easily add an image editor to their React Rich Text Editor. It offers a variety of features, such as image cropping, resizing, rotation, filtering, and annotation tools. Furthermore, it supports a wide range of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and WEBP, ensuring compatibility with most web applications. The seamless integration enhances user experience by allowing inline image editing directly within the rich text context, reducing the need for external tools.
